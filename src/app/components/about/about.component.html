                    <p>
                        I was born in the year 2000, in San Cristobal, Dominican Republic. From an
                        early age I have had a great inclination towards the world of technology, science, and
                        everything that allowed me to uncover new ideas. My interest for programming started at the age
                        of thirteen when I wanted to create a blog of my own. I quickly learned about HTML, CSS, and
                        JavaScript, then a couple of months later I had created my first website ever.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Since I started programming, I became fascinated with the idea of creating something totally new
                        with just a computer. After learning the basics of programming, I experimented with various web
                        development technologies like Bootstrap, jQuery, and Flask. In the recent years, however, I have
                        become more interested in data science and machine learning engineering as a career.
                    </p>

                    <p>I moved to the United States at the age of fifteen with the intention of obtaining a better
                        education. Five years later, in 2020, I completed an Associate in Science degree at the <a

                            target="_blank" data-no-ellipse-cursor>Rowan-Cabarrus Community College</a>. I then
                        transferred
                        to the <a href="https://www.uncc.edu/" rel="noopener"
                            title=" University of North Carolina at Charlotte" target="_blank"
                            data-no-ellipse-cursor>University of North Carolina at Charlotte</a> to complete a
                        Bachelor of Science in Computer Science degree with a concentration in Data Science.</p>
